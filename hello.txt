Hi my name is danzil.

Yo Yo what is your name.

Hamlet: Act 1, Scene 3

A room in Polonius' house.

Enter LARRY and OPHELIA

LARRY
My necessaries are embark'd: farewell:
And, sister, as the winds give benefit
And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,
But let me hear from you.

OPHELIA
Do you doubt that?

LARRY
For Hamlet and the trifling of his favour,
Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood,
A violet in the youth of primy nature,
